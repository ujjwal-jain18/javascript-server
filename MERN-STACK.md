### Express: A back-end web application framework
Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser.

### Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

## Benefits of MERN Stack
* The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript.
* JS is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code.
* With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.
* With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON.
* Using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
