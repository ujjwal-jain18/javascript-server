Feature of Vscode
1.prettier:- Prettier is an opinionated code-formatter. It prescribes a certain formatting style as the correct one, but its popularity is making its rules something of an established standard for JavaScript, CSS, and increasing numbers of other languages.

2.Multi-Cursor Shortcuts :-The ability to edit with multiple cursors can be a huge time saver. To use this most effectively requires memorisation of a handful of commands, but they’ll soon become second nature.

3.Text Wrap:-There aren’t many cases where I’d prefer my text to run off the screen, forcing me to use the dreaded horizontal scroll. To toggle wrapping on or off on a per-file basis, simply press ALT + Z .

4.Execute and Debug JavaScript:-There are several great options for executing and debugging JavaScript within Visual Code studio

Useful Plugins
1.Visual Studio Code CLI

Visual Studio Code comes with an inbuilt Command Line Interface. Once you’ve installed Visual Studio Code, and have it open, press ⇧⌘P to open the command palette for Mac, or just ⌘P and the press > button.

2.Git Integration

Sometimes using Git can be fun or hard, but Visual Studio Code comes with integrated Git that allows for Adding, Committing, Pulling and Pushing Changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.

3.Debugging

Debugging is a large topic, and is usually language/stack specific. Depending on the language you are using, there are available plugins that enable support for debugging, and you’ll be able to use breakpoints to debug your code when developing.

4.Live Share
Visual Studio Code Live Share is a feature that enables you to share your VS Code instance, and allow someone remote to control and run other things such as debuggers.Live Share is published as a plugin, and is currently in Preview.All that is required is for you to install the plugin, and the status bar will enable you share any working session by getting a link, once you are signed in.

5.Split Views, Zen Mode

If you like working on multiple open editors in the same project, you will find this feature really interesting. You can press OPT, and click on a file, or right click on a file and choose Open to the Side, to open more the file in a split view like shown below.

6.Helpers (Intellisense, Context Menus…)

I decide to call this section helpers because it consists of little things that are quite helpful when writing code.

7.Integrated Terminal

Most of the time when running code, there’s usually a terminal open either to the side, or somewhere in your machine.Visual Studio Code comes with an Integrated Terminal accessible through View > Integrated Terminal, and configurable through the settings: “terminal.external.osxExec”: “iTerm.app”,. The terminal usually opens by default in the workspace you are in, and can also have split views.

8.Plugins and Themes

Visual Studio Code has a rich plugin API, and this has enabled developers to create really awesome plugins. I’ll list a few common ones which I’ve used, but to get a comprehensive list.
